    <ol style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li>
            <h3 style="color: #40bbd1; margin-bottom: 5px;"> Step 1: Sign-Up</h3>
            You have two primary ways to begin your registration:
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Online:</strong> Visit <a href="https://org.tanda.africa" target="_blank">org.tanda.africa</a> to start the registration process. This is recommended for full merchant sign-up.</li>
                <li><strong>USSD (Alternative for some services):</strong> Dial *712# from your phone for certain functionalities.</li>
                <li>Verify your email address via the confirmation link sent to your inbox if applicable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color: #40bbd1; margin-bottom: 5px;"> Step 2: Provide Your Business Information</h3>
            During registration or in your "Business Profile" / "Account Settings" section:
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Enter your legal business name, address, and contact information accurately.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color: #40bbd1; margin-bottom: 5px;"> Step 3: KYC (Know Your Customer) Documentation</h3>
            To comply with regulations and ensure a secure platform, we require some documentation. Please have clear copies ready to submit:
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Business Permit:</strong> A valid permit for your existing business.</li>
                <li><strong>National ID:</strong> A copy of your National ID.</li>
                <li><strong>Passport Photo or Selfie:</strong> A clear, recent photo.</li>
                <li><strong>(If a registered company):</strong> You might also need your Business Registration Certificate/Certificate of Incorporation, KRA PIN certificate, and proof of address.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color: #40bbd1; margin-bottom: 5px;"> Step 4: Account Verification & Till Number</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> TandaPay will verify the legitimacy of your business and documents. This helps maintain a secure ecosystem for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Till Number:</strong> Once approved, you will receive your TandaPay Till number. Getting a TandaPay Till is <strong>free and instant</strong> upon successful onboarding.</li>
                <li>You can then download the <strong>TandaPay App (or Tanda Trader App)</strong> from the Play Store to manage your account.</li>
                <li>Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security if available. We highly recommend this!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color: #40bbd1; margin-bottom: 5px;"> Step 5: (Optional) Add Team Members</h3>
            If you have staff who need access, you can often add them as users with specific roles and permissions under "Team Management" or "User Settings" in the TandaPay portal/app.

    <h1 id="gtn-strategy" style="color: #faba09; border-bottom: 2px solid #faba09; padding-bottom: 10px;"> 5. Your Go-To-Market Strategy: Focusing on High-Value Zones</h1>

    <h2 style="color: #40bbd1;">Maximizing Revenue with TandaPay</h2>
    <p>To maximize your revenue with TandaPay, we encourage focusing your efforts on areas with high business potential.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #40bbd1;"> Why Focus on High-Traffic Areas?</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Increased Revenue:</strong> Malls, busy business districts, and affluent neighborhoods typically have a higher concentration of customers ready to make digital payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Merchant Performance:</strong> Businesses in these areas often have higher transaction volumes.</li>
        <li><strong>Tech-Savvy Customers:</strong> Consumers in these locations are generally more inclined to adopt digital payment solutions for convenience and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #40bbd1;"> Identifying Your Target Customers:</h3>
    <p>TandaPay is ideal for various retailers, including:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Retail Dukas, Mini Marts, and Supermarkets</li>
        <li>Chemists and Pharmacies</li>
        <li>Barbershops and Salons</li>
        <li>Cosmetics shops and Boutiques</li>
        <li>Electronics shops</li>
        <li>Hotels and Eateries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider the daily trade volume:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Serving over 250 customers daily (e.g., minimarts, wholesale shops in busy areas).</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Serving 100-250 customers daily (e.g., shops in apartment blocks, shopping centers).</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Serving less than 100 customers daily (e.g., small independent structures).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Focusing on Tier 1 and Tier 2 in high-value locations can significantly boost your TandaPay transactions.</em></p>
